## FAQ

### What is SageMaker?
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models.

Traditional ML development is a complex, expensive, iterative process made even harder because there are no integrated tools for the entire machine learning workflow. You need to stitch together tools and workflows, which is time-consuming and error-prone. SageMaker solves this challenge by providing all of the components used for machine learning in a single toolset so models get to production faster with much less effort and at lower cost.

### Is Amazon SageMaker prefers specific ML Framework?
No it is agnostic IDE, it provides optimized Apache MXNet, Tensorflow, Chainer, PyTorch, Gluon, Keras, Horovod, Scikit-learn, and Deep Graph Library containers. Also Amazon SageMaker supports your custom training algorithms provided through a Docker image adhering to the documented specification.

### Does AWS offer free tier for Amazon SageMaker?
Yes it offers and please check this free link for details https://aws.amazon.com/free/, and Specifically for Amazon SageMaker please check this page https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/

### Can you provide more materials about Feature Engineering?

### What is MXNet?
Apache MXNet is a fast and scalable training and inference framework with an easy-to-use, concise API for machine learning.

MXNet includes the Gluon interface that allows developers of all skill levels to get started with deep learning on the cloud, on edge devices, and on mobile apps. In just a few lines of Gluon code, you can build linear regression, convolutional networks and recurrent LSTMs for object detection, speech recognition, recommendation, and personalization.

You can get started with MxNet on AWS with a fully-managed experience using Amazon SageMaker, a platform to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. Or, you can use the AWS Deep Learning AMIs to build custom environments and workflows with MxNet as well as other frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Chainer, Keras, Caffe, Caffe2, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.

### Where can I learn more about MXNet?
Explore MXNet crash course https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/tutorials/getting-started/crash-course/index.html
Also here is Python tutorial https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/tutorials/

### How can I learn more about neural networks and deep learning?
Here is a free content rich book for deep learning https://d2l.ai/ it has notebooks to play with.

### Is there any more example notebooks to share?
Amazon SageMaker Examples repo on Github is very rich and it has many explained notebooks https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples.
Another Repo is Amazon SageMaker Workshops and it has easy to learn examples for common use cases and TensorFlow https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-workshop

### Which course will cover Machine Learning in Details?
Machine Learning Pipeline will dive deep for 4 days in Machine Learning and SageMaker
In this course, you will learn how to:
- Select and justify the appropriate ML approach for a given business problem
- Use the ML pipeline to solve a specific business problem
- Train, evaluate, deploy, and tune an ML model in Amazon SageMaker
- Describe some of the best practices for designing scalable, cost-optimized, and secure ML pipelines in AWS
- Apply machine learning to a real-life business problem after the course is complete

### Will we work on practical use cases and scenarios?
After the 4 days training, 4 use cases will be provided for the team in a month, and they will build their ML models to address these problems.
